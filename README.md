## Overview

Written in TypeScript and compiled to ES6 with inline source map & source. See [@selfage/tsconfig](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@selfage/tsconfig) for full compiler options. Provides the runtime lib to be used together with `MessageDescriptor` generated by `@selfage/generator_cli`, which can parse, copy, serialize and deserialize messages.

The term "message" stands for data class, inspired from Google's Protocol Buffers, i.e., in JavaScript/TypeScript case, an object without any functions defined on it, which is what can be communicated between different threads, processes, or distributed servers.
